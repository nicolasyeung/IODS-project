## Initial Thoughts
I have some experience with R and other languages like Python.  I find that the most challenging aspect is getting used to the logic of how RStudio and Git interact (i.e. <mark>getting the changes sent to my repository and getting the diary to update<mark>)

Feeling a little over my head but still interested in trying to learn.
